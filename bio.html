						</header>
						<p>The Following is Sphinx Logic's founders Biography </p>
						<hr />
						<h3></h3>
						<p>Born in Johnson City, and male and to Charlene Chatman or Chapman TN My family came to the area in the 50's from the UK before country music. and moved to Atlanta, GA. I had a heart murmur as a child. Live in the suburbs My first school was Sullins Academy in 1984 I tested as a INTJ-T Personality which in the top 1% of the general population in 2016. And tested as gifted in 1995. My mother and father are David and Charlene Moore my family includes the Surnames Chapman, Moore, Bright, Little, Vaughn and Turner.  All in surname Burke's Peerage. I'm Irish and Jewish. And I have 6 heredity titles in my family all of this I can prove. My mother Charlene Moore was a conductor at the Johnson City Symphony and I played with her when she was young. Business Journal Employee and YWYA Board Member. Read MAD Magazine and the Chronicles of Narnia as a child. My grandfather died at the age of 92 in 1989 and fought in the navy in WWII. My mother and father taught me to respect myself at a early age. </p>

<p>I was raised in high society after high school it is heritage and social class and computers. A computer is a heterogeneous system. I went to ivy league university. Which taught me not to trust anything but concrete methods. But play fair. To be ethical. To always treat women with respect but not let them patronize me. To always ask their last name. The computer taught me about nobility. In a heterogeneous environment you do not need to install updates if you want to enable legacy features. The computer taught me to marry women into the same nobility. And play by societies rules. I'm gifted and was born in a rural area which gave me a anger problem because I learned computers at a young age. I am a displaced adult because I grew up and invested in Washington, New Jersey, Massachusetts States. and London UK. I am a lifetime royal society of the arts fellow. I don't like fascism but the UK is at least better fascism than the USA. I believe in microeconomics for people's prosperity.  I believe in extant relationships and found Christ at 29 at university. I still don't believe people should marry for love or money.</p>

 <p>My first UNIX was OpenBSD which is based on the infamous BSD 4.4. Started using BOINC In 2002 with SETI. I started SELinux development in 2002. I blame the Obama administration for making computer science available to all because of infrastructure failure and technology standards are small I'm a 2002 Member of ECMA international. I bought Modern Operating Systems 2nd Edition in 2001 from Amazon. I was raised to strive in a top-down environment and it has never let me down. The Moore surname is the number one Irish pedigree of Ireland. The computer taught me to live sustainably. I have been tested for STD's and everything came back negative. I don't like feminists. I used to want a female relationship until I discovered in a academic study that they are unfaithful genetically. In Carl Zimmers 'Marriage and Evolution' women need to evolve more because men's y chromosome is more evolved than women's. I do still want a biological child however. I was saddened when UNESCO left the United States. For to loss of cultural heritage laws. Presented declassified CIA document to physicians on psychosis.  And I have a clean criminal record. I never drank Alcohol, Smoked for 1 year in high school. I started a Macromedia user group in 1997 and worked with a few artists and executives on 'Made with Macromedia' singles and interactive cdroms on fixed media. Hillman Curtis taught me graphics design in San Francisco Ca via his website. I applied to Harvard in 2000 but my ACT was not accepted. I had to stay in state. Don Box taught me the Component Object Model via Develop Mentor. in 2002 the most of my Microsoft engineering support incidents are from 2000, XP. 2003, Vista, 7, 2008, 8, 2012 and I made the Windows 8 PowerPoint official storyboards.</p> 

<p>My father helped me with my credit for jumbo loan but I'm inheriting a home too. I have about $8 million in unrealized capital gains. Which I may cash out if I ever went to market or form a trust. Net worth is a cash equivalent just the equity must be in the form of shares for salaries. I was a Digidesign Partner. Before I became a RSA fellow and helped with the Higgs Boson and Gravitational Waves with BIONC. For my college senior capstone, I worked on a missile container project for Northrup Grumman. in Falls Church Va. that used Java and Android as a team we built the Android operating system as well as the app. Linux is a certified UNIX brand at the Open Group.
